# Backup-models
Implementation of the three backup models from Cezanne-ai framework:

1. Encoder-decoder for chatbots. We are taking into consideration building multi-turn transformers from scratch and also fine-tunning the pre-trained model with additional datasets created on the core-input scenarios.
2. Open-Domain dialogue models with summarization-augmentation and dialogue datasets.
3. Open-Source Language Understanding and Dialogue Management. We are taking into consideration also an E2E model, with specific pipelines inside, to enhance the intent-entities-forms solution.

These models will be implemented with the same datasets as the main Cezanne-ai model, but in this repository will be implemented independent from the Cezanne.ai framework flow.

The final form of this model will be committed in new repository together with the other layers: CPL, NOG/NLG and NIU/NLU

Code implementation in progress

possible commit date: 1st September 2021
